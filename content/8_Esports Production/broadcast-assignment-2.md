### Broadcast Assignment 2

Having learnt how to set up OBS and stream/record video, in groups of no more than three, you will create and produce ONE of the two following:

* A 15-20 minute podcast talking about a recent esports event of your choosing
* Commentate over a recent esports match of your choosing

#### Podcast: 

The podcast should be filmed and recorded using OBS and should be no longer than 20 minutes in length. Before recording, work in your group to decide on an event to talk about and then write down some topics and talking points which you will cover. The conversation should flow naturally and each group member should contribute roughly the same amount to the conversation. You may want to nominate one member to fill a host role so they can steer the conversation. 

You can utilize [Canva](https://www.canva.com/twitch/templates/twitch-overlay/) to find some basic stream overlays which you can edit and import into OBS to get everything set up. 

The files which you will need to submit for this assignment are the podcast recording in a .MKV format and an export of your scenes used in the recording.

#### Commentating:

For this, choose any recent esports match, minimum 20 minutes in length, which you have access to the VOD on Twitch or Youtube. You can use the screen or window recording function in OBS to capture the VOD whilst you commentate over it. If you are not recording in the same room, it is recommended that the person capturing and recording also streams the match via Discord so that everyone is synced up.

Before recording, work with your group to ensure each of you has a clear role. It is recommended that one of you takes play-by-play, and the other(s) take an analyst/color commentary role.

The files which you will need to submit for this assignment is the OBS recording in a .MKV format.
