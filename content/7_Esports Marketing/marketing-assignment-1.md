### Marketing Assignment 1

Choose an esports team in any major game title. Identify three of their corporate partners or sponsors and give an overview of how the brands are activated or integrated by the team. 

#### Questions to help you get started:

* Who is the team and who are the partners?
* What sectors/categories does each partner occupy?
* Are the brands endemic or not?
* Does the sponsor only appear on certain rosters, why do you think that may be?
* How is the brand integrated by the team? Do you think it was effective?

Assignment should be 1-2 pages in length, double spaced, 12pt Times New Roman font. 

Do not simply answer the questions one by one, instead focus on writing in paragraphs and covering all bases succinctly.
